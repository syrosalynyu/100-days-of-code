# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sep 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart lesson 13: student account generator v2 (Refactoring).

**Thoughts:** I struggle with deciding whether using loop or iterator in the exercise, and find that Hash is really my weakness. But still, I feel good about my completion of today's exercise.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
