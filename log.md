# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I have been coding every day for the last couple weeks. And today, Sep 9, 2019 I'm publicly committing to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge ~ ~ ~

### Day 1: Sep 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart lesson 13: student account generator v2 (Refactoring).

**Thoughts:** I struggle with deciding whether using loop or iterator in the exercise, and find that Hash is really my weakness. But still, I feel good about my completion of today's exercise.

### Day 2: Sep 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 1.) How to define a method in ruby & 2.) Rspec intro on Learn.co

**Thoughts:** It's my first time hands on Rspec exercise and not quite sure about mechanism. I decide not to dive in until I get a hang of all the ruby's fundamentals!


### Day 3: Sep 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: using string interpolation + method(def) to indicate the value of each grid

**Thoughts:** This is my first exercise that contains ASCII character set to draw a graphic (the grids). It's a new experience and needs some time to process when creating the the method.

### Day 4: Sep 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart lesson 13: Walk-a-thon.

**Thoughts:** It doesn't take me long to create an array and inserted nested hashes to store data because I had a similar practice as Day 1, but the second section which asks for the Highest Earning Walker and Total amount earned drags me so long. I finally use max_by to locate the person who earn the most, and use map to extract the amount each person earned then add them up.

### Day 5: Sep 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart Live Day 3: exercise 3 (duck duck goose) & exercise 4 (require the user to enter the same value twice in order to add that value to the total)

**Thoughts:** I use iterator (times) combine with conditional statement for exercise 3 and loop (while) with conditional staement for exercise 4. I am feeling more comfortable with the loop and iterators.

### Day 6: Sep 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: sort, sort_by, and descending sort 

**Thoughts:** Try to use different way to acending and descending the order for the same array, but I have no luck on making the sort_by provdes the correct result. Will work on this tomorrow.

### Day 7: Sep 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: a.) Solve the problem from yesterday. I used .sort_by in the if statement, but did not make it consistent in the else statement (I used .sort instead.). Once I change it from .sort to .sort_by in the else statement, it solves the problem. b.) Half way through the Codecademy > Learn Ruby > A night at the Movies. Will continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** This type of bug is hard to find because I did not get any error message. I can't really locate the bug unless I look into each line.


### Day 8: Sep 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: completed Codecademy > Learn Ruby > A night at the Movies

**Thoughts:** Practice "case...when.." using Codecademy's exercise. Also learned ".nil?" to see if a key exist in the has. I first used "== nil" but found that ".nil?" is the better way.

### Day 9: Sep 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Codecademy 7. Refactor is half way done.

**Thoughts:** There are things like Ternary Conditional Expression, Conditional Assignment ( ||= ), and if/unless in one line I have never learned before. Will continue on second half of chapter 7 and also complete the exercise in chapter 7 tomorrow. 

### Day 10: Sep 19, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Codecademy 7. Refactor second half done & learn about Boolean Zen on Ada JSL Day 4

**Thoughts:** Learned about methods like .upto/.downto and .respond_to? and more practice on the Conditional Assignment ( ||= ), and if/unless in one line. Want to try out JSL Day 4 exercise tomorrow.


### Day 11: Sep 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart Live Day 4: Password Verification

**Thoughts:** I wrote 2 versions. The first version can lead to a problem: once I input a PW that has more than 8 charactors, the first whole loop will discontinue. Any future PWs I input that are less then 8 charactors wouldn't show's the statement "Your password needs to have 8 characters or more." anymore. 
<br>
Therefore, I create a second version using "until" loop with ifs statememts in it. Once the PW meets the requirement, the program will prompt for the password again. And then I use while loop to determine whether the second entry of PW is same as the approved PW that we input earlier.
It is such a challenge, but I have a lot of fun :)

### Day 12: Sep 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: JSL Day 5 required exercise 1, 2, 3

**Thoughts:** exercise 3 is kinda tricky. Will have to research on that. What I have in mind right now is to use .map to split the "fire" and the rest part.

### Day 12: Sep 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: JSL Day 5 required exercise 3, 4, 5, 6

**Thoughts:** For exercise 3, I learned about using .map plus .gsub() to remove spacing from each element in an array; using .map plus .clice() to remove unwanted characters from each element in an array. 
For exercise 6, I learned about when rand() method is called with no arguments, it returns a float that is greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.

### Day 12: Sep 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: JSL Day 5 optional exercise 1, 2, 3

**Thoughts:** Question 2 wants me to input a entence and count the frequency of each letter, and qurstion 3 wants me to change binary value to decimal value. Different methods that I applied can lead to switching between array and string. I haven't resolve this problem, and will continue tomorrow.
