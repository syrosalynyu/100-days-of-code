# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I have been coding every day for the last couple weeks. And today, Sep 9, 2019 I'm publicly committing to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge ~ ~ ~

### Day 1: Sep 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart lesson 13: student account generator v2 (Refactoring).

**Thoughts:** I struggle with deciding whether using loop or iterator in the exercise, and find that Hash is really my weakness. But still, I feel good about my completion of today's exercise.

### Day 2: Sep 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 1.) How to define a method in ruby & 2.) Rspec intro on Learn.co

**Thoughts:** It's my first time hands on Rspec exercise and not quite sure about mechanism. I decide not to dive in until I get a hang of all the ruby's fundamentals!


### Day 3: Sep 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: using string interpolation + method(def) to indicate the value of each grid

**Thoughts:** This is my first exercise that contains ASCII character set to draw a graphic (the grids). It's a new experience and needs some time to process when creating the the method.

### Day 4: Sep 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart lesson 13: Walk-a-thon.

**Thoughts:** It doesn't take me long to create an array and inserted nested hashes to store data because I had a similar practice as Day 1, but the second section which asks for the Highest Earning Walker and Total amount earned drags me so long. I finally use max_by to locate the person who earn the most, and use map to extract the amount each person earned then add them up.
