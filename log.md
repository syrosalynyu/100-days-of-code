# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sep 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart lesson 13: student account generator v2 (Refactoring).

**Thoughts:** I struggle with deciding whether using loop or iterator in the exercise, and find that Hash is really my weakness. But still, I feel good about my completion of today's exercise.

### Day 2: Sep 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 1.) How to define a method in ruby & 2.) Rspec intro on Learn.co

**Thoughts:** It's my first time hands on Rspec exercise and not quite sure about mechanism. I decide not to dive in until I get a hang of all the ruby's fundamentals!
