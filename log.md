# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I have been coding every day for the last couple weeks. And today, Sep 9, 2019 I'm publicly committing to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge ~ ~ ~

### Day 1: Sep 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart lesson 13: student account generator v2 (Refactoring).

**Thoughts:** I struggle with deciding whether using loop or iterator in the exercise, and find that Hash is really my weakness. But still, I feel good about my completion of today's exercise.

### Day 2: Sep 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 1.) How to define a method in ruby & 2.) Rspec intro on Learn.co

**Thoughts:** It's my first time hands on Rspec exercise and not quite sure about mechanism. I decide not to dive in until I get a hang of all the ruby's fundamentals!


### Day 3: Sep 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: using string interpolation + method(def) to indicate the value of each grid

**Thoughts:** This is my first exercise that contains ASCII character set to draw a graphic (the grids). It's a new experience and needs some time to process when creating the the method.

### Day 4: Sep 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart lesson 13: Walk-a-thon.

**Thoughts:** It doesn't take me long to create an array and inserted nested hashes to store data because I had a similar practice as Day 1, but the second section which asks for the Highest Earning Walker and Total amount earned drags me so long. I finally use max_by to locate the person who earn the most, and use map to extract the amount each person earned then add them up.

### Day 5: Sep 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart Live Day 3: exercise 3 (duck duck goose) & exercise 4 (require the user to enter the same value twice in order to add that value to the total)

**Thoughts:** I use iterator (times) combine with conditional statement for exercise 3 and loop (while) with conditional staement for exercise 4. I am feeling more comfortable with the loop and iterators.

### Day 6: Sep 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: sort, sort_by, and descending sort 

**Thoughts:** Try to use different way to acending and descending the order for the same array, but I have no luck on making the sort_by provdes the correct result. Will work on this tomorrow.

**Link to work:** [sort, sort_by, and descending sort](https://repl.it/@syrosalynyu/sort-sortby-descending-sort)

### Day 7: Sep 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: a.) Solve the problem from yesterday. I used .sort_by in the if statement, but did not make it consistent in the else statement (I used .sort instead.). Once I change it from .sort to .sort_by in the else statement, it solves the problem. b.) Half way through the Codecademy > Learn Ruby > A night at the Movies. Will continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** This type of bug is hard to find because I did not get any error message. I can't really locate the bug unless I look into each line.


### Day 8: Sep 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: completed Codecademy > Learn Ruby > A night at the Movies

**Thoughts:** Practice "case...when.." using Codecademy's exercise. Also learned ".nil?" to see if a key exist in the has. I first used "== nil" but found that ".nil?" is the better way.

**Link to work:** [case when + if/else](https://repl.it/@syrosalynyu/case-when-if-else)


### Day 9: Sep 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Codecademy 7. Refactor is half way done.

**Thoughts:** There are things like Ternary Conditional Expression, Conditional Assignment ( ||= ), and if/unless in one line I have never learned before. Will continue on second half of chapter 7 and also complete the exercise in chapter 7 tomorrow. 

### Day 10: Sep 19, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Codecademy 7. Refactor second half done & learn about Boolean Zen on Ada JSL Day 4

**Thoughts:** Learned about methods like .upto/.downto and .respond_to? and more practice on the Conditional Assignment ( ||= ), and if/unless in one line. Want to try out JSL Day 4 exercise tomorrow.


### Day 11: Sep 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Ada JumpStart Live Day 4: Password Verification

**Thoughts:** I wrote 2 versions. The first version can lead to a problem: once I input a PW that has more than 8 charactors, the first whole loop will discontinue. Any future PWs I input that are less then 8 charactors wouldn't show's the statement "Your password needs to have 8 characters or more." anymore. 
<br>
Therefore, I create a second version using "until" loop with ifs statememts in it. Once the PW meets the requirement, the program will prompt for the password again. And then I use while loop to determine whether the second entry of PW is same as the approved PW that we input earlier.
It is such a challenge, but I have a lot of fun :)

### Day 12: Sep 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: JSL Day 5 required exercise 1, 2, 3

**Thoughts:** exercise 3 is kinda tricky. Will have to research on that. What I have in mind right now is to use .map to split the "fire" and the rest part.

### Day 12: Sep 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: JSL Day 5 required exercise 3, 4, 5, 6

**Thoughts:** For exercise 3, I learned about using .map plus .gsub() to remove spacing from each element in an array; using .map plus .clice() to remove unwanted characters from each element in an array. 
For exercise 6, I learned about when rand() method is called with no arguments, it returns a float that is greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.

### Day 12: Sep 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: JSL Day 5 optional exercise 1, 2, 3

**Thoughts:** Question 2 wants me to input a entence and count the frequency of each letter, and qurstion 3 wants me to change binary value to decimal value. Different methods that I applied can lead to switching between array and string. I haven't resolve this problem, and will continue tomorrow.

### Day 12: Sep 25, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: JSL Day 5 optional exercise 1, 2, 3 completed

**Thoughts:** For exercise 3, I used two different ways to convert the binary value to decimal number. 1.) to_i(base=2) 2.) use each_with_index to iterate 0's and 1's with the converting formula => element * 2 ** i. 
Fun exercises to work on.

### Day 13: Sep 27, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: JSL Day 5 Array exercise

**Thoughts:** Practice on array using Ada's JumpStart Live material. I feel more confertable with using array, but I foudn that I tend to misued parentheses () to access elements. I should use square brackets [] instead.

### Day 14: Sep 29, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: JSL Day 6 Nested Hashes exercise

**Thoughts:** I found that the solution of question "How could you add, "Christine Martin" to the clusters?" is incorrect. It was using the answer from the previous question. Therefore, I replaced it with the correct answer.
A did a [pull request](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start-live/pull/27) and hopefully Ada will merge my changes to their master brach.

### Day 15: Sep 30, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: JSL Day 6 exercise

**Thoughts:** I am trying to use times iterator to collect inputs from user, then fill in these inputs into hashes. But for some reason, my times iterator doesn't work properly. It stores only the final set of data to all hashes, and all the previous data sets are missing. I will have to investigate on that tomorrow.

### Day 16: Oct 1, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed JSL Day 6 exercise

**Thoughts:** I found out the reason it my iteration didn't work as expected. There was nothing wrong with my times iteraor, but was the way how I create the array. I was using `friends = Array.new(number_of_friends, {})`, but the proper way to create hashes inside of the array is by using `friends = Array.new(number_of_friends) { Hash.new }`.

### Day 17: Oct 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Complete Learn Ruby Chapter 8 (Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas) on Codecademy 

**Thoughts:** I learned that `Proc` and `lambda` can help creating a block that can be called over and over again. They are pretty much the same and are interchangeable, excep `Proc` will return immediately without going back to the calling method, but `lambda` will passes control back to the calling method. Using `Proc` and `lambda` can keep my code DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).

### Day 18: Oct 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Codecademy 9. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING I is half way done.

**Thoughts:** `class` is a blueprint for an object. Instance variables (@), Class variables (@@), Global variables ($) => in order to distinguish their different, they have their unique symbol to start with. I think reading and hands-on are needed before getting familiar with `class` 

### Day 19: Oct 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Codecademy 9. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING I second half.

**Thoughts:** The lecture introduces `super`, but I don't quite understand how does it work.  I think reading and hands-on are needed.
